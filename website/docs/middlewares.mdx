# Middlewares

Middlewares are functions that execute before the main API handler. They are used for performing tasks
such as authentication verification, request logging, error handling, and more. You can apply middleware
to the entire application, to specific routes, or to a scope of routes within a folder.

## Usage

### File Location and Scopes

To implement middleware, create a file named `middleware.js` (or .ts, .cjs, etc.) and place it in the api folder.
This file will be executed for every request.

```
├── api/
│  └── middleware.js <-
├── server.js
└── package.json
```

To limit the scope, place the middleware file inside a specific folder. For example:
```
├── api/
│  ├── users/
│  │  ├── ...
│  │  └── middleware.js <-
│  └── index.js
...
```

In this case, the middleware will only execute for endpoints under `/users/*`.

### Middleware Declaration

Each middleware receives all the arguments passed from the initial request handler, with the last argument always
being the next function. This is provided automatically, giving you control over the incoming arguments.
Depending on the platform, you can utilize `req` and `res` objects, just the `req` object, or any other arguments
you need.

Here's an example of a middleware implementation in a Node.js/Express.js API:
```js
export default function useMyMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  // Code before
  // ...

  await next(); // <-- The router's code or next middleware (on nested levels)

  // ...
  // Code after
}
```

### List of Middlewares

To compose multiple middlewares, arrange them in an array and export it as the default. They will execute sequentially
in the order they are listed.

```js
// file: api/middlewares.js
import { useLogger, useSentry, useAudit } from '../middlewares';

export default [
  useLogger,
  useSentry,
  useAudit
];
```

## Usage in File Routes

To use middlewares in file routes, just return an array with middlewares before the request handler.
For instance:

```js
// file: api/users/[id].[post].js
import { PersonSchema } from '../../schemas';

export default [
  useSchemaValidation(PersonSchema),
  createUser
];

function createUser(req, res) {
  // ...
}
```

In this example setup, `useSchemaValidation(PersonSchema)` serves as a middleware that validates the request
against `PersonSchema`.Once the request passes through this middleware, it then proceeds to the createUser function,
which handles the actual request logic.

## Interrupting the Chain

To interrupt the chain of middlewares, call a return before `await next()` or throw an error. If you're interested
in how to handle such errors inside other middlewares, see the [Error Handling](#error-handling) section.

This is an example code of a middleware that checks if the user is authenticated. All middlewares after this one
including the matched request handler, will not be executed.

Here's an example of an authentication middleware in a Bun.js API, demonstrating how to interrupt
the middleware chain:

```js
export async function useAuth(req, next) {
  const auth = req.headers.get('Authorization');
  // Some logic to check if the user is authenticated
  if (!auth) {
    return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 });
  }

  await next();
}
```

Using with the Node.js HTTP module or Express.js:
```js
export async function useAuth(req, res, next) {
  const auth = req.headers.authorization;
  // Some logic to check if the user is authenticated
  if (!auth) {
    return res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
  }

  await next();
}
```

## Error Handling

As mentioned previously, you can interrupt the middleware chain by throwing an error. Occasionally, other middlewares
or the request handler itself might accidentally encounter an error. To manage these errors, simply wrap `await next()`
in a try/catch block within the middleware. Place this logic early in the middleware chain to ensure it captures
errors from all subsequent middlewares and request handlers.

```js
export async function useErrorHandler(req, res, next) {
  try {
    await next();
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send(error.message);
  }
}
```
