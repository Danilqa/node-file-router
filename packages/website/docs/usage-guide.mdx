# Usage Guide

1. Initialize all routes by invoking `initFileRouter`. This is an asynchronous function that will
construct a table of URL patterns. It creates a function which will call the matched file.
2. Call the created function on each request with `request`, `response`, and others more you need.

```js
import * as http from 'node:http';
import { initFileRouter } from 'node-file-router';

const useFileRouter = await initFileRouter();

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  useFileRouter(req, res);
  // ... your code below
});
```

:::tip Note

Everything described below is related only to default Node.js incoming / outcoming
message interfaces. It works for default http server and Express.js. Create [custom adapter](/own-adapter)
if you use sockets, different framework, etc.

:::

For every incoming HTTP request, the library takes its URL. It then attempts to match this URL
with a corresponding file in your application.

For instance, on request with url `/users/123/orders/456` the `/users/[productId]/orders/[orderId].js`
will be invoked.

:::tip Great news!

It works with any popular types: `ts`, `js`, `cjs`, and `mjs`.

:::

Use functions or objects with methods in the target files. And **default export them**.

## Function

The function will be invoked on any request method: `get`, `post`, `patch`, etc.

```js
export default function(req, res, routeParams) {
  // Take dynamic route params from the last argument
}
```

:::tip Note

Anything what goes in `useFileRouter` won't be mutated. Route params are passed always as the last argument.
For instance, for Express.js it will be: `function(req, res, next, routeParams)`.

:::

Get the route params from dynamic paths in the last argument. For instance,
in this file `/users/[productId]/orders/[orderId].js` these params are available:
`{ productId, orderId }`. More details are described on the [route matching part](/docs/route-matching).

## Object with methods

Specify functions for each method type using objects. The rules for functions are identical.
The main difference only that it belongs to method. Not listed method function will lead to the 404 error.

```js
export default {
  get(req, res, routeParams) {
    const { documentId, draftId } = routeParams;
    res.end(`Requested document ${documentId} and his draft ${draftId}`);
  },
  post(req, res, routeParams) {
    const { documentId, draftId } = routeParams;
    res.end(`Created draft ${draftId} for document ${documentId}`);
  },
  patch(req, res, routeParams) {
    // ...
  },
}
```
